"""Capabilities service implementation for REST.

This module implements the CapabilitiesService from the Storage API, which
provides service discovery functionality. It allows clients to:
- List available services and their versions
- Discover top-level addresses (root URIs) handled by this server
- Query routing patterns to determine which addresses this server handles

This enables clients to gracefully handle different service capabilities
and route requests to the appropriate service instances via HTTP endpoints.
