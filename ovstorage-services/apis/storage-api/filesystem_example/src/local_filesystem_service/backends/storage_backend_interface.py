"""Storage Backend Interface for pluggable storage implementations.

This module defines the abstract interface that all storage backends must implement
to be used with the Storage API service layer. This allows swapping different storage
implementations (local filesystem, Git repository, cloud storage like Dropbox, etc.)
without modifying the REST or gRPC service code.

The interface abstracts away backend-specific details like:
- How files are physically stored
- How versions are managed
- How metadata is persisted
- How folders are represented
- How uploads/downloads are handled

Backend implementations must provide all methods defined in StorageBackendInterface.

class StorageBackendInterface(ABC):
    """Abstract interface for storage backends.

    All storage backends must implement this interface to be compatible with
    the Storage API service layer. The interface provides operations for:
    - File operations (read, write, delete, stat)
    - Folder operations (create, list, enumerate)
    - Versioning (enumerate versions, create versions)
    - Metadata (get, update, delete user-defined metadata)
    - Identity/resource address conversion
    - Permission checking

    Resource Address Format:
        Resource addresses are URIs that identify resources in the storage system.
        Format: <scheme>://<netloc>/<path>
        Example: "file-storage://server/path/to/file"

    Resource Identity Format:
        Resource identities are opaque identifiers that uniquely identify a specific
        version of a resource. They are backend-specific but must be:
        - Encodable as strings
        - Routable (can be converted back to resource addresses)
        - Version-specific (each version has a unique identity)

    Versioning Model:
        - Each write operation creates a new immutable version
        - Versions are identified by resource identities
        - Resource addresses point to the "latest" version
        - Versioned addresses can reference specific versions: <address>;version_number
