"""FastAPI application setup and route configuration for REST service.

This module sets up the main FastAPI application and mounts all service
sub-applications for different API versions. The Storage API uses semantic
versioning with alpha/beta/stable releases, where different API versions
can have different feature sets and are mounted separately.

Services are organized by version:
- v1alpha: Includes all services including experimental features (Copy, Move, ListRoutes)
- v1beta: Includes only stable, production-ready services

Each service is mounted at its versioned path (e.g., /v1alpha/fileobject).

# The Storage API uses semantic versioning with alpha/beta/stable releases.
# Different API versions can have different feature sets and are mounted separately.
# We follow channel based releases, so alpha in one specific version is a strict superset of beta, which in turn is a
# strict superset of the release version if any is available.
