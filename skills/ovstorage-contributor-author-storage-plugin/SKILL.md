# Author a Storage Plugin

## Goal

Implement a backend plugin that advertises truthful capabilities, streams bytes
without buffering whole objects, maps errors into ovstorage codes, and passes
the plugin conformance harness.

## Recipe

1. Start with [`docs/public/plugin-development/README.md`](../../docs/public/plugin-development/README.md)
   for the shared C ABI, manifest, loader, and build loop.
2. Use [`docs/public/plugin-storage/README.md`](../../docs/public/plugin-storage/README.md)
   for the storage-specific `Factory` and `Backend` contract.
3. Mirror the small reference backend in
   [`ovstorage-plugin-file`](../../ovstorage-core/crates/ovstorage-plugin-file/README.md)
   before introducing vendor SDK complexity.
4. Set capability bits only for operations the backend actually honors.
5. Add streaming-invariant coverage for any streaming read or write path.
6. Run `make verify` before merge.

## Review Checks

- Manifest name/version come from Cargo package metadata.
- Secrets only travel through credential fields or credential providers.
- Write success means durable backend state is visible to a following read.
- Unsupported operations return `Unsupported` and do not advertise the matching
  capability.
