# Verify Before Merge

## Goal

Run the same checks CI uses and catch common mistakes before review.

## Recipe

1. Run `git status --short` and make sure only intended files changed.
2. Run `make verify`.
3. Run `make test`.
4. If skills changed, run `cargo run -p xtask -- validate-skills`.
5. Confirm no vendored services files changed with
   `git diff --name-only -- ovstorage-services/`.
6. If generated headers changed, verify they were regenerated with
   `make verify-headers-clean`.
